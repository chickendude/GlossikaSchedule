# Glossika Schedule
This is just a simple tool to track your progress in Glossika's (http://www.glossika.com) new schedules.

It currently only supports one schedule (5-month intensive), but adding other schedules will be easy to implement.

# Todo
- Divide schedules into language, so you can add multiple languages.
- Allow you to choose which schedule you want, perhaps with a description of each.
