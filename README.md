# Glossika Schedule
This is just a simple tool to track your progress in Glossika's (http://www.glossika.com) new schedules.

It currently only supports three schedule types, but i'll soon add others once i get more core functionality working.

You can add multiple languages and schedule types. As of 1/3/2017 all of Glossika's currently released courses are included, but if your language isn't included then you can just pick another language and use that. It doesn't really matter.
