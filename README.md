# Glossika Schedule
This is just a simple tool to track your progress in Glossika's (http://www.glossika.com) new schedules.

It currently only supports three schedule types, but i'll soon add others once i get more core functionality working.

# Todo
- Divide schedules into language, so you can add multiple languages.
- [DONE] Allow you to choose which schedule you want, perhaps with a description of each.
